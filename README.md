This is a webapp I created for my FDE Team in my First year. Its for Ashesi Students to book rides on a bus to off-campus
or when returning to campus

#Details
It has an admin and user section. Users who signup have to verify their email addresses before they can use the webapp.
Users can revoke their bookings, change their passwords, check their credit balance etc
Admins can revoke bookings, extend or restrict the maximum number of bookings for a particula day etc
To test this app import the tables from the database folder into your own; create an admin or user account to navigate the features

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, I am all ears

And oh, the app is hosted here https://eazygo.herokuapp.com/ and https://eazygoo.000webhostapp.com/
